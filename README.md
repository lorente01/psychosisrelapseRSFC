# psychosisrelapseRSFC
This repository contains the data and the code necessary to generate the results for the group comparison of the SCI in the project "Striatal functional connectivity in psychosis relapse: A comparison between antipsychotic adherent and non-adherent patients at the time of relapse"
Only the code is necessary, as it reads the csv files directly from GitHub.
